## Automated Features

1. **Welcome Message and Role Selection**
   When a new user joins the server, the bot will send a welcome message in the [‚ï≠‚Ä¢ÀñÀöüéâ·¥°·¥á ü·¥Ñ·¥è·¥ç·¥á-…™…¥Íú∞·¥è] channel. The message will prompt the user to select a role by reacting to the message with the appropriate emoji.

2. **Role Verification**
   After a user selects a role, the bot will send a message to the [‚ï≠‚Ä¢ÀñÀöüè∞·¥Ñ·¥è·¥ú…¥·¥Ñ…™ ü-·¥Ñ ú·¥Ä·¥ç ô·¥á Äs] channel for Elders to manually verify and assign the role.

3. **Curse Word Detection**
   The bot automatically detects curse words in messages and issues warnings to users. After three warnings, the user is automatically muted for 3 hours.

4. **AI Responses**
   When the bot is mentioned in a message, it will respond using AI-generated text. These responses are friendly and may occasionally include references to Call of Duty Mobile.

## Role Hierarchy
